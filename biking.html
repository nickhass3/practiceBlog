    <h1>Nick's Advice about Biking Seattle</h1>
    <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
      <p>Seattle is within a short day trip to many mountains.
        There are lots of great places to mountain bike or downhill bike.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mt. Rainier</li>
        <li>Cascade Mountains</li>
        <li>Olympic Mountains</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Local Trail Biking</h2>
      <p>There are a plethora of paved/gravel biking trails in the greater Seattle area.
      I think most people that are casual bikers purchase hybrid bikes that are great for both
      the pavement and the gravel.</p>
    <h2>City Biking</h2>
      <p>Seattle is one of America's most bike friendly cities.
      Road bikes are light and provide a great riding experience if you're using it to commute.</p>
